THEZZAZZGLITCH'S FOOLS2022 - AUTOMATION RULES
===============================================================================

So you want to make automated requests to Fools2022 backend servers.

I strongly believe that everyone should be able to enjoy the Fools Events in
any way they see fit. Creating custom tools that interact with the servers
is very much in the spirit of the challenge and is completely allowed!

However, to avoid problems, make sure to stick to a few basic rules.
These rules are just standard software development practices and you should
follow them regardless of anything - but just in case, here they are:

1. Introduce yourself. Make sure your automated tools send a meaningful
   User-Agent header, to make them recognizable.
   Example: parzival-mapdumper/1.0.0.
   Requests coming from generic User-Agents, such as "urllib" or "curl",
   might get falsely recognized as DoS attempts and blocked.

2. Respect ratelimiting. Remember that Fools Events usually have tens of
   people all playing at once. Trying to steal all of the server processing
   time for yourself is just rude!
   Therefore, all requests to backend API are subject to ratelimiting:

   - A maximum of 4 requests per second in general.
   - A maximum of 1 requests per second for in-game packet commands
     (/packet/* endpoint).

   Exceeding this limit will cause your requests to be dropped with status
   code 429 Too Many Requests. Make sure you properly space out your
   requests to avoid triggering this condition.

   If your user account has Cracker Cavern III completed and Wholesome
   Reward unlocked, you can double your packet request rate to 2 requests
   per second!
   To make use of that privilege, send your packets to the /turbopacket/*
   endpoint instead of the /packet/* endpoint.

3. Don't be evil. Don't do things that actively try to ruin the fun for
   everyone. I might ban people doing naughty stuff at my own discretion.

   Note: using multiple IP addresses to bypass ratelimiting counts towards
   this rule. Please don't be greedy... think about all of those people who
   just want to play the game!

4. Use exponential backoff. This is just a fancy way of saying: if the
   request fails, make sure to wait for a bit before trying again, and
   increase the delay each time something goes wrong.
   Spamming the server with useless requests is generally not advisable.

With all of that in mind, I wish you best of luck while writing your cool
map dumpers and lottery bots. Have fun!
